IAM

1. Backup IAM Bindings
   
    a. Export IAM policies periodically using gcloud projects get-iam-policy, folders, or organizations.
  
    b. Store backups in Cloud Storage or Secret Manager.
    
    c. Schedule backups using Cloud Scheduler + Cloud Functions.

    Summary
    
      a. Periodically export IAM policies at project/folder/org level.
      
      b. Store them securely for audit and rollback.
      
      c. Automate the process for daily or weekly backups.

 2. Use Terraform to Manage IAM

    
  a.Store IAM roles/bindings in Terraform as source of truth.
  
  b.Use google_project_iam_member, binding, or policy resources.
  
  c.Keep configurations in source control (e.g., GitHub) and state in GCS or Terraform Cloud.

 
   Summary
 
    a. Use Terraform to define all IAM bindings.
    
    b. Version control access policies.
    
    c. Allows instant re-provisioning of IAM in DR regions or restored projects.
  
 3. Restore / Reapply IAM in DR
    
  a. If a project is recreated in a DR scenario, apply saved Terraform IAM configs or re-import IAM policy JSON via gcloud set-iam-policy.
  
  b. Ensure service accounts and keys are re-created with same permissions.

 Summary
 
  a. Apply saved IAM policies from backup or Terraform.
  
  b. Recreate custom roles and service accounts as needed.
  
  c. Ensure principle of least privilege remains intact.

 4. Protect IAM Configurations
    
  a. Enable Audit Logs for all IAM operations.
  
  b. Monitor with Cloud Monitoring and Security Command Center for unexpected IAM changes.

 Summary
 
  a. Log and alert on policy changes.
  
  b. Detect permission escalations or deletions proactively.

------------> Notebook <-----------

1. Backup Notebook Content
   
  a. Save notebook content to a versioned Cloud Storage bucket.
  
  b. Automate using nbconvert + Cloud Scheduler/Function or built-in Jupyter auto-save to GCS.
  
  c. Optionally snapshot the persistent disk of the VM.

  Summary
  
    a. Back up .ipynb files regularly to GCS.
    
    b. Enable versioning in the backup bucket.
    
    c. Optionally use disk snapshots for full VM-level restore.

2. Cross-Region Notebook Replication

   
  a. Set up backup notebooks in a secondary region.
  
  b. Use Terraform or custom scripts to:
    -> Create notebook instances
    ->  Attach previously saved notebooks
    -> Restore settings (machine type, image, metadata)
    
 Summary
 
  a. Re-create notebook instances in DR region using IaC.
  
  b. Restore notebooks from GCS backups.
  
  c. Automate this via CI/CD or disaster triggers.
  

3. Use Terraform for Notebook Infra
   
  a. Define notebooks in Terraform using google_notebooks_instance.
  
  b. Parameterize region, disk size, container image, machine type.
  
  c. Maintain separate DR module/config for replication.

 Summary
 
  a. Use IaC to define notebooks for consistent, reproducible environments.
  
  b. Easily deploy to DR region using Terraform.
